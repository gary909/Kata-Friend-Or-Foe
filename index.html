    <p>
        Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.<br>
        <br>
        If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, <br>
        you can be sure he's not...<br>
        <br>
        Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]<br>
        <br>
        i.e.<br>
        <br>
        friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]<br>
        Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.<br>
